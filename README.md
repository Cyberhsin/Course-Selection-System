# Course-Selection-System

This is just a Java Web coursework which used SpringMVC + Hibernate, so it's very rudimentary. But if you're bored enough to want to run it, please follow below steps:

1. Run the `sql/course-selection.sql` to create table.
2. Update the `dataSource` in `src/config/applicationContext.xml`.
3. Build it to Tomcat to run it.
